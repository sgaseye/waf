'--proxy' (--proxy='http://proxy.example.com:3128') - address of the proxy-server to access the target.
'--header' (--header 'Authorization: Basic YWRtaW46YWRtaW4=' --header 'X-TOKEN:ABCDEF')  - allowsto set additional headers (useful if the target uses Basic Authentication or other access restriction mechanisms.
'--block-code' ( --block-code='222' or --block-code='403' - block-code='222') - allows to set the WAF response status(es) when blocking a request (useful if the WAF uses response statuses other than 403 or uses different statuses for different block types).
'--threads' ( --threads=15) - allows to set the number of parallel threads during cƒ∏aning (10 by default).
'--timeout' ( --timeout=10) - allows to set the time to wait for the response from the server (30 by default).
'--json-format' --output results in JSON format (by default as tables).

alert('1)
But the result can also be represented in other ways:

onerror='alert`1`'
top[/al/.source+/ert/.source](1)
al\u0065rt(1)
And the payload

<a href="javascript:alert()">x</a>
might look like:

<a href=\"j&Tab;avascript&colon;a&Tab;lert()\">x</a>
Well, in conclusion, for those who ƒ∏think that SQL injections should contain an escape character, you can consider such a payload:

1 union select password from users
That is, about the same request will go to the database:

SELECT foo FROM bar WHERE id = 1 UNION SELECT password FROM users;
Tips and tricks:

You can use a different UTF-8 Text character set in the search field. This would look something like:

SELECT * FROM users WHERE name LIKE 'ÔΩÅÔΩÑÔΩçÔΩâÔΩé';

<!DOCTYPE :_-_: SYSTEM "http://"
<!DOCTYPE {0xdfbf} SYSTEM "http://"
Remove <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-16"?>


You can bypass Akamai WAF's XXE filters by HTML encoding the SYSTEM entity within a payload like this:

https://github.com/IvanGlinkin/Fast-Google-Dorks-Scan
https://github.com/AnonymousJass/OSINT-Google-Dorks


Dorking is a technique that uses advanced search operators within Google Search and other search engines to find information. Primarily used to locate security holes in the configuration and computer code within websites, Dorks can also provide investigators with opportunities to enhance intelligence gathering during OSINT investigations.

Advanced search operators are special commands within search engines that modify searches by adding parameters to narrow searches and drill deeper into results.

We‚Äôve outlined 14 advanced search operators that can be useful to investigators to refine search results, which include:

‚Äúsearch term‚Äù = exact phrase, i.e. "Skopenow streamlines your due diligence and claims process"
Quotation marks enable users to force an exact match for required words or phrases. The exact match operator can be used to refine results to ensure that a specific phrase is included in the results or to exclude synonyms when searching for single words. Searching for an exact phrase during an investigation can locate material written by a specific person or business.

OR or | = either search term or search term, i.e. Ed OR Edward or Ed|Edward|Edwin
The OR operator enables searching for multiple words as alternatives to one another, locating either X or Y or both. The pipe (|) operator functions identically to ‚ÄúOR‚Äù. Investigators can utilize the OR operator when only a nickname is known for a subject, enabling different variations of the same name to be searched at once.

+ or AND = search term and search term, i.e. Steve Adams AND Skopenow
The AND operator enables searching for results that must include two different words phrases, searching for both X and Y. Results will only include results that include both search phrases. The plus (+) operator can also be used in place of ‚ÄúAND‚Äù. AND can be useful for investigators when searching for information on a person, ensuring results relate to them by including their employer‚Äôs name.

- = Not search term, i.e. Skopenow -www.skopenow.com
The minus operator enables users to exclude a word or phrase from search results. When results are extensive, removing irrelevant words that feature prominently in numerous results is particularly useful when looking to reduce results.

site: = Only on this site, i.e. ‚ÄúSkopenow‚Äù site:twitter.com
The site operator enables users to restrict results to only those from a specific website. When investigating a business, the site operator can ensure results come specifically from their official website.

filetype: = Only this type of file, i.e. OSINT filetype:pdf OR filetype:docx
The filetype operator enables search results to be restricted to those that are a specific file type, removing other file types and standard web pages. filetype: can provide benefit during an investigation when searching for contracts and whitepapers in PDF or Word documents.

intitle: = Only show results where text is in title of site, i.e. intitle:final.attendee.list "Fraud"
The intitle operator enables users to find web pages with a certain word or phrase in the title. Investigators can use the intitle operator to find relevant web pages and articles containing a relevant keyword.

inurl: = Only show results where text is in the web address of a website, i.e. inurl:resume ‚Äújohn smith‚Äù
The inurl operator enables users to find web pages with a certain word or phrase in the web address. Investigators can use the inurl operator to find relevant web pages containing a keyword in the web address.

intext: = Only show results where text is in the main body of the text of a website, i.e. Skopenow intext:OSINT
The intext operator enables users to find web pages with a certain word or phrase in the main text of the web page. Investigators can use the intext operator to locate results where a keyword within the body of a web page will limit results, such as a year or location name.

allintext: = locate all words in a web page, i.e. allintext: skopenow insurance fraud
The allintext operator enables users to find web pages that contain a list of keywords in the main text of the web page but not necessarily next to one another. Investigators can use the allintext operator when more than one keyword is necessary as an anchor within the body of a webpage to find results, such as multiple keywords or names related to a crime.

cache: = Only show cached links, i.e. cache:skopenow.com
The cache operator enables users to return the most recently cached version of a webpage when the web page has been indexed. Investigators can use the cache operator to locate previous versions of edited or deleted web pages to locate removed intelligence.

* = wildcard, i.e. "robdouglas*com"
The asterisk operator represents a wildcard within search strings, taking the place of words or phrases between two keywords. Investigators can use the asterisk operator to find email addresses by replacing the domain name with the wildcard character.

map: = map a specific location, i.e. map: Manhattan
The map operator enables users to force Google to show map results for a locational search. The results show only location-specific data and do not include recent news stories. Investigators can use the map operator to focus on geospatial relevant intelligence.

Skopenow augments investigations by instantly building comprehensive, court-ready, digital reports on businesses and individuals. Skopenow collects, collates, and analyzes information from data sources, including social media, the dark web, associated vehicles, court records, and contact data.

Advanced Search Operators
Quotes
To find an exact sentence or phrase, use quotation marks
For example, ‚ÄúOSINT tools for social media‚Äù
Exclusions
Use a minus sign to exclude words or certain sites
For example, -tweet or -Twitter.com
Logic
Use OR or the symbol | with no spaces
For example: Authentic8 OR NeedleStack, alternatively Authentic8|NeedleStack
Extensions
To find a certain filetype, use filetype: (followed by a colon) or ext:
Then add PDF, jpg, png, et al., after the colon (follow ext with a colon and the file type, no spaces)
For example, ext:jpg NeedleStack logo
To look for multiple file types, use parentheses around your search, such as ext:(jpg OR pdf OR png)
Intitle, Intext and Inurl
To find specific text in a title, the text of a site page or the url, simply search Intitle: followed by your query. 
For example, Inurl:zero-trust-managed-devices or Intitle:FAQ
Adding all to the beginning of any of these will only reveal results that only meet the criteria of all of the parameters
Such as, allintext:‚Äùdangers of free Wi-Fi‚Äù
Site
To only search within a certain site, use site: (with no spaces) in front of your query
For example, Site:authentic8.com ‚ÄúGoogle Dorking‚Äù
Timestamps
To find a site posted before or after a specific date, you can use after:[date] or before:[date] 
For example, before:2016
Fill in the blank
Using an asterisk allows Google to fill in a possible missing word. For instance, to find an email address, you can use [username]*com
For example: NeedleStack*com




















site:example.com ext:doc | ext:docx | ext:odt | ext:rtf | ext:sxw | ext:psw | ext:ppt | ext:pptx | ext:pps | ext:csv 
site:s3.amazonaws.com + example.com
site:accounts.example.com inurl:user_id
site:example.com inurl:login | inurl:signin | intitle:Login | intitle:"sign in"

The endpoint on ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà accepts a POST request with an XML document. A Web-Application Firewall 
(WAF) successfully blocked all requests that contained any of the keywords <!DOCTYPE, <!ENTITY or <!ELEMENT, 
that are necessary for XXE attacks to be successful. However, it was possible
 to bypass the WAF protection, leading to the request being passed to the XML parser.

The word "on" is very important to Bypass Waf on Cloudflare

For Example:

<svg/Animation/onload=alert(1)>
<svg/hackerone/onload=alert(1)>
'">one,two<svg/onload=alert(1)>

still there is "on" word.Soo it can also Bypass the WAF.

In my latest premium post on The Web Scraping Club substack (https://lnkd.in/d7UX8V_E) I've written about a new technique I've experimented for bypassing Cloudflare bot protection.

#webscraping #bot #webdata #scraping #scrapy






WAF Bypass (Cloudflare)
Eg - abc[dot]com

Check if Website is using Cloudflare, there are various methods to know this but easiest will be Wappalyzer browser Ext.

Procedure:

1) Find IP Address of abc[dot]com. Using Ping Method
2) Login into Shodan and search: hostname:abc[dot]com (It will list down all origin IPs)
3) Try to Open each IP address Manually, It could lead to bypassing WAF and Cloudflare. #bypass #WAF #cloudflare

3-Ways to Bypass Anti-bot Reverse Proxy:

If a reverse proxy(Eg: Cloudflare Antibot Technology) is in place, it can be more difficult to determine the IP address of the origin server. However, there are a few methods that can be used to try and identify the end server IP address:

1. Look for X-Forwarded-For headers: Reverse proxies often add X-Forwarded-For headers to requests that are forwarded to the origin server. These headers can contain the IP address of the client that made the request as well as the IP address of the last proxy server in the chain. By examining these headers, it may be possible to determine the IP address of the origin server.

2. Check DNS records: It may be possible to determine the IP address of the origin server by examining the DNS records for the domain name. If the reverse proxy is configured to use a specific subdomain or IP address to forward traffic to the origin server, this information may be visible in the DNS records.

3. Use traceroute or a network sniffer: It may be possible to use traceroute or a network sniffer to trace the path of a request from the client to the origin server. This can help to identify the IP address of the origin server.

It's important to note that attempting to bypass the reverse proxy or access the origin server directly can be a violation of website terms of service or even illegal. It's best to only attempt to identify the origin server IP address for legitimate reasons and to contact the website administrator or support team for assistance if needed.

How can you Hack into any ChatGPT account, including saved conversations, account status, chat history and more!

A tale of 4 ChatGPT vulnerabilities üëá

We can discuss it now that the #OpenAI team has confirmed it's completely fixed.
--
In pic1 :-
we are getting a "HIT" cache status of an API request (not a static file).

This means an "API" request is cached since Cloudflare thinks this is a static file request that needs to be cached.

Hence you can forge an exploit based on a URL like pic2 :
GET /backend-api/conversations%0A%0D-testtest.css?offset=0&limit=20

Send it to a victim, and upon accessing it ‚Äì his own "API" response will be cached, and if you recheck the same URL (i.e. fetching the cached response of the victim), you will be able to see the victim's HTTP response, which contains the conversations' titles.

This is called a cache deception attack
--
Now getting to the juicy part‚Äîthere is more to it.

In pic 3 new vector to bypass the fix of the original account takeover attack

So u can appended the URL-encoded representation of tabulation (\t) ‚Äì %09, and that Payload (%0A%0D%09), WORKED ü´†

And here, you can able to bypass OpenAI fix of the original account takeover issue with a new payload, which brings this issue back to life ‚Äì taking over any user account lik pic4

Have you ever found a great exploit in a web app test, only to be blocked by Cloudflare? Consider this trick to pull the origin server IP and (hopefully) bypass the CDN entirely:
 
Cloudflare works as an intermediary between the client and server. If we can get the origin server IP, we can bypass all protections the Cloudflare CDN is providing (WAF, DDOS protection, etc).
 
Now how can we do it? We can target the ‚ÄòForgot Password‚Äô feature of the application. Assuming the mail server is hosted by the same IP address as the web server, a threat actor could find the IP Address from a header within the outgoing email. See the attached screenshot for where to find this.
 
If this does not work, you can also send an email to a non-existent email address on the target server (EX: non-existent@target[.]com). This will cause a bounce (because the user doesn‚Äôt exist) and the delivery will fail, resulting in receiving back a notification containing the Origin IP of the server sending the email.
 
As long as there are no security measures/virtual hosting restrictions that prevent the application from loading directly on the discovered origin IP, then we can successfully bypass Cloudflare! If you have any other tricks/tips, feel free to let me know in the comments.

Did you read about the latest SQL injection vector that takes advantage of JSON support in SQL? It bypassed Imperva, PaloAlto, Cloudflare, AWS, and F5 WAFs.

But once again, Contrast Protect stopped it out of the box - without any changes. Because our runtime protection has much more context than a WAF. Our customers' apps and APIs were completely protected from....
* Struts EL injection
* Log4Shell
* Spring4Shell
* Atlassian EL Injection
* and many others
Protect prevents exploitation of both zero-days in libraries *and* custom vulnerabilities in your app/api code. You can dramatically reduce the risk from SQL Injection, EL Injection, command injection, XSS, CSRF, SSRF, XXE, path traversal, and most of the other major types of vulnerability. No more firedrills.

Also , if you come across new technology, never ignore it. Read the documentation and try to recreate the environment locally. This helped me as i was able to acess the dashboard using default credentials as

Hello ppl !!!!!!!!!!!

Read my first blog üéâ on medium about "Insecure File upload basic bypass Technique and How to Exploit it"

Authentication Bypass & File Upload & Arbitrary File Overwrite

https://lnkd.in/dHAJqxhq








File uploads are a common feature in web applications. However, they can be vulnerable to several types of bugs such as Remote Code Execution, Unrestricted File Upload, File Overwrite Attack, Path Traversal Attack, Large File Denial of Service, Server-Side Injection Attack, Metadata Leakage and ImageTragik Attack.
Some of them Which I LOVE :
1. RCE via File Upload
2. XSS via Filename
3. XSS via Metadata
4. XSS via SVG file
5. Blind XSS via SVG
6.SSRF via Filename
7.SSRF via SVG Upload
8.SSRF via Iframe in Html
9.XXE via File Upload
10.CSRF on File Upload
11.Exif MetaData Leakage
12.OpenRedirect via SVG File Upload
13.Large File DOS
14.File Upload Bypass
15.File Name Vulnerability
16.Pixel Flood Attack
17.CSV Injection

Hi everyone! I have just written another article on "Different Ways to Bypass File Upload Filters"

Check it out: https://lnkd.in/dDFfCTUx








White Oak Security discovered an instance of Gladinet‚Äôs CentreStack server which was vulnerable to an authentication bypass and an arbitrary file upload resulting in remote code execution.

Red Teaming: Adversary Simulation 
Bypassing Windows Defender üíª ‚ò¢

Attack chain: .vbs ‚û° .cmd ‚û° .dll [Payload] ‚Üî C2

Some notable methods used are:
‚û° Process injection
‚û° Direct syscalls and Nt APIs
‚û° Memory encryption

In this video, I wanted to demonstrate the above mentioned functionality of manual process injection in combination with other techniques being used in a practical attack scenario. Although a VBScript file is used for initial execution, this can be any other file depending on the AV/EDR being used on the machine.

Direct syscall and Nt APIs both are used depending on the options provided with the commands being used. Also, in order to use direct syscalls the retrieve method is used to retrieve all the SSNs for the required APIs at runtime. The SSNs can be retrieved from a new process or the current process, depending on the option specified with the command.

The implant also uses manual PE parsing to retrieve API address, section address, resources etc.

The custom C2 is used as an initial C2 that can be used to execute other implants for C2 frameworks like metasploit as demonstrated in this video. Furthermore, multiple payloads can be uploaded at runtime to execute in memory, avoiding any kind of disk detection.

The injected payloads are protected from initial detection during calls for thread creation as Windows Defender does catch kernel events on thread and process creation and does not use any API hooks.

üî•An Easy DC Story for example.comüî•
[Note-down the tools]

1. A web application with a file upload feature
2. Uploaded WebShell - https://lnkd.in/d35yhGyj
3. The application was using a service account.
4. EFS Potato Privilege Escalation: https://lnkd.in/dKcj2ktE.
5. DMZ bypass with webshell to SOCKS tunneling.- https://lnkd.in/dj2UTNBB
6. DomainPassword Spray with crackmapexec (Example@1234): https://lnkd.in/dSTVPQ46
7. Domain Admin Password Reveled ;)
8. PrivateVPN installation for the persistence.

Sometimes, thinking simply can reveal sensitive information.
Red Team Tip:
Consider the target as a coconut.
Once you break the shell.
It's all juice and cream for you.
